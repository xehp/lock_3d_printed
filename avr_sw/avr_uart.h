History

2005-02-16
Modified for atmega8 and renamed. 
Used some code from an GPL avr platform written by Lukas Karrer.
Henrik Bj√∂rkman

2005-07-01
cleanup
Henrik

2005-07-09
Renamed uart_packet to uart_buf
Henrik

2005-07-09
Renamed uart_packet to uart_buf, moved it to its own file.
Henrik

2012-05-12
Removed buffered mode. Keeping only stream mode.
Henrik

2012-05-21
Restored some extra features.
Henrik

2016-08-02
renamed the functions for compatibility with another project.
